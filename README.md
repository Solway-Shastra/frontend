# Why Solway?

## Issues while checking in: 
One of the big issues while hotel booking is the verification of identity while checking in to the hotel. This effective DApp completely eliminates the need to do an identity verification while offline check-in. This solves the problem of misuse of personal records by the Hotel Management.

## Limited payment methods:
We are working to integrate Solana Pay to increase the payment methods and to give users a flexibility to pay with a payment method of their choice be it Crypto, USDT or any other currency.

## Commission by the big platforms:
This decentralized platform completely removes any middleman or third party. The whole process of Escrow is done by the Smart Contracts. Thus making the process economical.

## No need for currency conversion:
As the payment method is based on tokens, there is no need to convert your currency to the local currency system. The new way of Globalized currency works everywhere.
